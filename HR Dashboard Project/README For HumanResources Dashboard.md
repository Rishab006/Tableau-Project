# HR Dashboard Project

## Objective
As an HR manager, I need an all-encompassing dashboard that enables me to analyze human resources data effectively. The dashboard should include both high-level summary views for quick insights and detailed employee records for in-depth exploration.

## Summary View

The summary section will be organized into three key areas: **Overview**, **Demographics**, and **Income Analysis**.

### **Overview**
This section will provide a snapshot of key HR metrics, such as:
- Total counts of hired, active, and terminated employees.
- Trends in employee hiring and terminations over the years.
- A breakdown of employees by department and job titles.
- A comparison of employee counts between the headquarters (HQ in New York) and other branches.
- The geographic distribution of employees by city and state.

### **Demographics**
This section will offer insights into the workforce composition, focusing on:
- Gender distribution within the organization.
- Age group and education level breakdowns for all employees.
- Total employees in each age group and education category.
- An analysis of the relationship between educational background and performance ratings.

### **Income Analysis**
This section will concentrate on salary trends and comparisons:
- Analysis of salary variations across different education levels, segmented by gender to identify patterns or discrepancies.
- Correlation between age and salary for employees within each department.
